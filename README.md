## Cyber Security Project
# Clash of Teams 101 - Breach & Defend
# (Complete Adversarial Simulation Report)

# 1. Introduction
This project demonstrates a full adversarial simulation involving both offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) operations within a controlled virtual lab environment. The objective was not only to compromise a vulnerable system but also to detect, analyze, and remediate the same attack using professional monitoring techniques.
The simulation provides a 360-degree understanding of how cyberattacks occur, how they appear in network logs, and how defensive strategies can prevent further compromise.

# 2. Phase 1 – Environment Setup
# 2.1 Lab Configuration
A virtual lab was created using VMware with two machines configured on the same internal network.
| Role| Operating System | IP Address
 `````  `````````````````  ``````````
| Attacker | Kali Linux | 192.168.40.128
| Target | Metasploitable 2 | 192.168.40.129
Both systems were placed in the same virtual network to allow direct communication.
